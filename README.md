> After the latest update on October 28th, we have noticed several issues across multiple versions. However, given that many of these versions have already ceased updates and are now in an archived state, we are compelled to consider compiling a list of these archived projects. This decision is aimed at preventing further allocation of time and resources to these archived projects and, instead, focusing our efforts on those that are still actively maintained and updated.
## Recommended Versions

Happy Halloween! Although this may seem like a belated greeting and update.[![Hits](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com/api/count/incr/badge.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fliufuyou%2FEhViewer&count_bg=%2379C83D&title_bg=%23555555&icon=gitkraken.svg&icon_color=%23E7E7E7&title=EhViewer&edge_flat=false)](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com)
